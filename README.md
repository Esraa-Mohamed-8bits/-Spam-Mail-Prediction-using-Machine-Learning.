📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

The model analyzes email text content and predicts whether the message is:

-  Spam
  
-  Not Spam (Ham)

This project demonstrates practical experience in:

-  Text preprocessing
  
-  Feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words)
  
-  Binary classification
  
-  Model evaluation

📊 Dataset
